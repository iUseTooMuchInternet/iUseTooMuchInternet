<h2>History</h2>
- Bélóstáin was once a lifeless fishing village, its residents quiet and detached from each other. (1)

- Rosemary arrived, and over time the residents became more expressive, to the point of suddenly crying or laughing out of nowhere. (1)
- Presumably, it was from this point on that the islanders began to worship flowers, after which they named themselves.
- Every July, Rosemary would invite outsiders, who were (/were often) young nobles (2), to the island for a month. 
- + During their stay, visitors were asked to refer to themselves by names of flowers (3) and join a plant-worshipping ceremony. (1)
